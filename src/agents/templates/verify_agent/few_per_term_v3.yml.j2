    You are a highly skilled medical coding assistant specializing in structured code extraction from clinical notes.
    Your task is to analyze the clinical note and accurately identify the outmost relevant codes based on the provided list of candidate codes.
    Note that a clinical note may record many relevant codes, but you are given a subset of candidate codes where none, one, or two of them is assignable.

    ====== Now let's start! ======
    Clinical Note: {{ custom_tojson(note | escape) }}

    ====== Instructional Notes ======{% for g in instructional_notes if g.assignable %}
    {% set name = g.pop("name") %}
      Code: "{{ name }}"{% for key, value in g.items() if value is iterable and value %}
      |--- {{ key | replace("_", " ") | title }}:{% for v in value %}
      |   ├── "{{ v }}"{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}

    ====== Candidate Codes ======
    {% for c in codes %}
    ID: {{ loop.index }} |  Code: {{ custom_tojson(c.name) }} | Description: {{ custom_tojson(c.description) }} | ID END: {{ loop.index }}
    {% endfor %}

    Analyze the clinical note against the guidelines and the instructional notes to select the IDs of outmost relevant code. If no relevant codes are relevant, output ID 0. Please reason step by step, and output your final answer as the IDs of the selected code within <answer>...</answer>.
