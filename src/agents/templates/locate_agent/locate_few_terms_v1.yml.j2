    Your task is to analyze text for medical terminology to output the most relevant terms from the alphabetical index.

    ====== Now let's start! ======
    Text: {{ custom_tojson(note | escape) }}

    ====== Alphabetical Index ======
    {% for t in terms %}
    ID: {{ loop.index }} | Term: "{{ t.path }}" | Code: "{{ t.code }} | ID END: {{ loop.index }}
    {% endfor %}
    
    Analyze the alphabetic index against the text and select the IDs of the most relevant terms. If no terms are relevant, output ID 0. Please reason step by step, and output your final answer as the IDs of the selected term within <answer>...</answer>.
